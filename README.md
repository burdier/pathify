# Welcome to Pathify!


Stupid CLI program that enables you to create a dictionary of key:value where value is a path and key 
are the name of workspace that you wanna go. 

These are options until now.

 - [x] New
 - [x] List 
 - [x] Go 
 - [ ] Delete
 - [ ] Actions

Demo:
go to [Pathify](https://asciinema.org/a/EcdNVoCuEytmjNKAXfH5cRgyx)

> nota:
	> Pathify save the config file in   ~/.workspace.ini
	> The emojis are random, the command list generate these emojis.

# Linux and Mac
Using python:

pip install pathify

Also you can clone this repo and execute this command:

python setup.py build
